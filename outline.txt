- Title: The Predictability of {Highway/Roadway} Crash/Accident ...

1. Evaluation methods
	- description of true process: intensity and density, etc
	- description of terms (level sets, alpha, etc)
	- surveillance plots
	- PAI, etc
	- threshold based surveillance vs. fixed allocation based surveillance

2. Predictability of Crash Data
	- Focus on spatial prediction. Given a time period, how well can we say *where* crash occurs
	- data:
		- highway data
		- crash data
	- empirical performance measures (evaluate optimal performance - using only training data, no model)
		- vary segment
		- vary time (e.g., full year, each month, daytime, dow, etc)
		- show that e.g., mondays are more predictable than sundays. 
			- in extreme: for continuous time and space, then perfectly predictable. 
			- another extreme: worst (optimal) performance should be from using full year and large grid/segment size
	- use type 1 to predict, use type 2 to evaluate
		- type 1: day-time, type 2: night-time (etc, many scenarios)
		- show performance according the the evaluation methods we defined in 1.
		
3. Crash Model Evaluation
	- We may not need this for the paper, I will evaluate after first two parts are written
	- Apply a standard model (no new methodology here)
	- evaluate according to the methods we outlined
	- show how close to optimal the method performs
